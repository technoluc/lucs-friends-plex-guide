### Getting Started

With over 450+ films and 40+ television shows - my Plex server is always kept up to date with the most recent media releases which I can share with family and friends.

All you need is to register for a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/sign-up/) account - and once complete - let me know the registered email address so I can send you an invite.

Once you've let me know your Plex email address - you'll receive an email invite allowing you access to my TV and Movie collection. **You must follow the invite link in the email to gain access to the shared media libraries**.

On-going TV shows are automatically downloaded on release - and new movies are added as and when they become available - so you can sit back and enjoy.

### Watching Plex

You can watch media via a Plex player pretty much anywhere you have an internet connection. The Plex media server has a maximum upload speed of 50000 Mbps and can transcode 3/4 media streams simultaneously. The majority of the content is in HD (720p or 1080p) - with some movies available in UHD (4k).

All movies and TV come with Dutch and/or English subtitles where possible -

Plex has support for a wide range of platforms - from laptops, desktops, and phones to smart TVs and media streaming devices. You can see the full list of compatible player devices [here](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/apps-devices/). Typically it's a case of downloading the Plex app from the relevant 'app store' and logging in using your account.

### Requesting Content

Whilst I'm a big fan of my TV/Movie collection - you may find it's missing certain films or TV shows that you'd like to watch. I've implemented [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) to allow anyone with access to my Plex media server to request any film or TV show they like.

To access Overseerr visit [https://lucflix.nl](https://lucflix.nl) - where you will be able to login using your Plex account.

Overseerr lets you browse and search for the content you want to see added to the media server. Find the item you want to be added and simply select the 'Request' button and select the desired quality -

You can also choose to request all - or specific series of a TV show -

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5352226/147899582-a56e6029-57e3-4458-b0db-d9b83a47028f.png)

In the case of television shows - you can simply select the specific seasons you wish to request.

*Note - 'HD - 720p/1080p' is most likely to yield results - but don't be afraid to request 'HD-1080p' (the default option).*

At present all requests will be manually reviewed by myself - and I will ensure the highest quality file(s) are downloaded. Overseerr will indicate when your request has been completed -

Overseerr also provides a way to view content already held on the media server - and also allows you to raise issues should you have any playback issues -

This allows you to inform me of any problem with the video files - and fix/update accordingly.

### Ensuring the best quality for playback 

By default - the Plex player will limit the quality of videos streamed to 720p. The vast majority of content is available in 1080p or better - so be sure to update the relevant settings -

#### On TV

Go to the left hand menu > down to settings > video quality and change ‘internet streaming’ to ‘maximum’.

#### In Browser

Click the spanner icon at the top right to go to the settings page. From the left hand menu find the section titled 'Plex Web' and select 'Quality'. From here change the internet streaming video quality to 'maximum'. 

### Known Issues

In some instances, a username/password popup may appear. This can simply be dismissed/canceled.
